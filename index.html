<h2>
    Who the fuck am I?
</h2>
 <p>
    Im from India. I live in Pune, Maharashtra. 
    Im a 17 year old lazy mf. I absolutely hate chemistry. I was a good scorer in high school, but online classes fucked that up.
    As of now, i study Math, Physics and Chemistry, but very soon, that will change.
</p>


<h2>
    Ambition
</h2>
<p>Im a tired mf. I wanna be a software dev, work 9 to 5 in the future and earn lots of money.
But that isnt the only reason im pursuing this career. I find programming very fun, and useful. Im learning a lot of low level programming as of now.
Im not very fond of web development. Heck, i even forgot basic html, had to google a lot of this shit.</p><p> I can code stuff in java, python (somewhat), javascript(if i try, sure), C (still learning). Might add C++ to this list soon.

<h2>Why only use HTML in this webpage?</h2>
<p>I have two reasons.
    <ol>
     <li>Zero interest in learning html and css. </li>
     <li>I had my eyes opened by this very interesting website.</li>
    </ol>
