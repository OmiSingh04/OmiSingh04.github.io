<h2>
    Who the fuck is Sandy?
</h2>
 <p>
    Im an 18 year old lonely mf. Im from India. I live in Pune, Maharashtra. I am in my first year in University. I study math, programming and electronics as of now. I like the subjects, although electronics can be boring at times. <br>
 My favourite band is cage the elephant. Weird name i know.
</p>

<h2>Random</h2>
<p>I dont play games anymore. Linux doesnt have good games, and i dont wanna bother using wine. I do play truck simulator on phone tho :D. Jk im not that boring i promise you. OK MAYBE I AM.<br>
	I like Deadpool.<br>
</p>
    

<h2>
    Ambition
</h2>
<p>I wanna be a software dev, work 9 to 5 in the future and earn lots of money.
But that isnt the only reason im pursuing this career. I find programming very fun, and useful. Im learning a lot of low level programming as of now. I also intend to learn a lot about microprocessors, and even emulate one hopefully. CPU's are very interesting.
Im not very fond of web development. Heck, i even forgot basic html, had to google a lot of this shit.</p>


<p> I can code stuff in java, python, C, javascript(if i try, sure). Might add C++ to this list soon. <br>
